Z800/X800 Linux Kernel Driver v0.6

About:
 
  A kernel driver for the eMagin Z800/X800.  Most of the USB packet
info came from eMagin's publically released source code for their
EMADevice SDK.

WARNING:

  This is ALPHA software.  It might destroy your system and/or
your HMD.  You try this software at your own risk.  Don't come
crying to me if your system/hmd stops working.  You've been 
warned. 


Requirements:

  - Z800/X800 HMD (duh)
  - Kernel 2.6.17 or greater.  It may work with an earlier
    kernel, but I haven't checked.  Success/failure reports 
    are welcome.
  - Kernel support for loadable modules


Installation:

 The Short version:

    make
    make install
    make load

 The Longer Version:

   1) Run "make".  This will create the kernel module.
   2) Run "make install".  This will copy the kernel module into
      your system's /lib/modules/2.6.??/extra directory with the
      module name "z800.ko"
   3) Run "modprobe z800".  This will load the module into the kernel.
      Check your dmesg file.  If all goes well, it should successfully
      see your Z800.  If not, send me the report.


Testing:

  I've included a small test program to show how to control the 
Z800.  Run "make test" and then "./z800Test".  It should print out 
the Z800's firmware version and wake it up (note: the led on the control
base may still be blinking, but the HMD's screens should be active ).


TODO:
  - add proper locking in the driver
  - use wait_event_interruptable instead of looping
  - add missing controls ( 3DFLIP, etc )
  - add EEPROM property programming (offset, gain, etc )
  - fix dev/z800:0 location.  Use "/dev/z800/0" instead for
    better multi z800 support
  - only activate the read_urb when needed, not constantly
  - add hmd tracking!!  Need usb info for that.
  - get it into the linux kernel mainline
  - many others...   


Known Bugs:
  - once 3D Stereo is enable, it can't be disabled until the Z800
    is disconnected.  Don't know why.
  - even after the Z800 is woken up, the led on the controller 
    is still flashing, even though the HMD's screens are active
